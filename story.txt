Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”

When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.

“Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down the hill.

Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.

As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.

Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn’t come to help.

At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.

“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.

An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”

There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine.

For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.

Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.

But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.

Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”

Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. “The golden touch is no blessing,” Midas cried.

One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food. He searched high and low, but couldn’t find something that he could eat.

Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.

To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but missed yet again.

He tried a few more times but kept failing.

Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home. While he walked away, he muttered, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”

Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was growing next to an ugly cactus.

Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus on his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks.

One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.

Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer, as friends.

One day, Molly the milkmaid had filled her pails with milk. Her job was to milk the cows, and then bring the milk to the market to sell. Molly loved to think about what to spend her money on.

As she filled the pails with milk and went to market, she again thought of all the things she wanted to buy. As she walked along the road, she thought of buying a cake and a basket full of fresh strawberries.

A little further down the road, she spotted a chicken. She thought, “With the money I get from today, I’m going to buy a chicken of my own. That chicken will lay eggs, then I will be able to sell milk and eggs and get more money!”

She continued, “With more money, I will be able to buy a fancy dress and make all the other milkmaids jealous.” Out of excitement, Molly started skipping, forgetting about the milk in her pails. Soon, the milk started spilling over the edges, covering Molly.

Drenched, Molly said to herself, “Oh no! I will never have enough money to buy a chicken now.” She went home with her empty pails.

“Oh, my goodness! What happened to you?” Molly’s mother asked.

“I was too busy dreaming about all the things I wanted to buy that I forgot about the pails,” she answered.

“Oh, Molly, my dear. How many times do I need to say, ‘Don’t count your chickens until they hatch?’”

One day, two friends were walking through the forest. They knew the forest was a dangerous place and that anything could happen. So, they promised to remain close to each other in case of any danger.

All of a sudden, a big bear was approaching them. One of the friends quickly climbed a nearby tree, leaving the other friend behind.

The other friend did not know how to climb, and instead, followed common sense. He laid down on the ground and remained there, breathless, pretending to be dead.

The bear approached the friend lying on the ground. The animal started to smell his ear before slowly wandering off again because bears never touch those who are dead.

Soon, the friend who hid in the tree came down. He asked his friend, “My dear friend, what secret did the bear whisper to you?” The friend replied, “The bear simply advised me never to believe a false friend.”
There once was an old miser who lived in a house with a garden. The old miser used to hide all his gold coins under stones in his garden.

Every night, before he went to bed, the miser went out into his garden to count his coins. He continued the same routine every day, but he never spent a single, golden coin.

One day, a thief saw the old miser hiding his coins. Once the old miser went back into his house, the thief went to the hiding place and took all the gold.

The following day, as the old man came out to count his coins, he found it was gone and started wailing loudly. His neighbor heard the cries and came running, asking what had happened. Upon learning what had occurred, the neighbor asked, “Why didn’t you just save the money inside your house where it would’ve been safe?”

The neighbor continued, “Having it inside the house would make it easier to access when you need to buy something.” “Buy something?” answered the miser, “I was never going to spend my gold.”

When hearing this, the neighbor picked up a stone and threw it. Then, he said, “If that’s the case, then save the stone. It’s as worthless as the gold you’ve lost.”

One day, one of the pups was overcome by curiosity and wondered why they weren’t allowed to go near the well. So, he decided he wanted to explore it.

He went down to the well and climbed up the wall to peek inside. In the well, he saw his reflection in the water but thought it was another dog. The little pup got angry when his reflection was imitating him, so he decided to fight it.

The little pup jumped into the well, only to find there was no dog. He began to bark and bark until the farmer came to rescue him. The pup had learned his lesson and never went back to the well again.
Once, there was a young boy. This boy had problems controlling his anger. When he got angry, he would say the first thing that came to mind, even if it affected people.

One day, his father gifted him a hammer and a bundle of nails, then said, “Whenever you get mad, hammer a nail into the backyard fence.”

In the first days, the boy used up half of the nails. Over the next weeks, he used up fewer nails, until his temper was under control. Then, his father asked the young boy to remove a nail for each day he didn’t lose his temper.

On the day when the boy removed his last nail, his father told him, “You have done good, boy. But, can you see the holes in the wall? The fence is never going to be the same. Likewise, when you say mean things in anger, you’ll leave a scar.”
Once, there was a man who visited foreign lands. When he returned, all he could talk about was the wonderful adventures he had and the great deeds he had done.

One of the feats he told was about a leap he made in a city called Rhodes.

“The leap was so great,” the man said. “No other man can make such a leap. Many persons in Rhodes saw me and can prove I am telling the truth.”

“No need for witnesses,” said one who was listening. “Suppose that this city is Rhodes, now show how far you can jump.”
A wolf had gotten seriously hurt during a fight with a bear. He wasn’t able to move, and so, could not satisfy his thirst or hunger.

One day, a sheep passed by his hiding place, and so the wolf decided to call out to him. “Please fetch me some water,” said the wolf. “That might give me some strength to get some solid food.”

“Solid food!” the sheep said. “I suppose that means me. If I brought you something to drink, it would merely be to wash me down. Don’t speak to me about fetching a drink.”
A farmer asked his son to take their herd of sheep grazing every day.
While the boy watched over the sheep, he got bored and decided to have some fun.
So, he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!”. Upon hearing this the villagers ran to help him chase the Wolf away.
As they reached him, they realized that there was no Wolf and he was just kidding. The villagers were furious and they yelled at the boy for creating chaos and panic.
On the next day and the boy shouted “Wolf!” again and once again the villagers came to help him and saw that there was no wolf. This made them very angry again.
On the same day, the boy saw an actual Wolf that has terrorizing the sheep. The boy cried “Wolf! Wolf! please help me” and no villagers showed up as they believed that the boy was joking again.

A poor Brahmin lived in a village all alone. He had no friends or relatives. He was known for being stingy and he used to beg for a living. The food he got as alms were kept in an earthen pot which was hung beside his bed. This allowed him to easily access the food when he got hungry.  


On one day, he got so much rice gruel that even after completing his meal, there was so much leftover in his pot. That night, he dreamt that his pot was overflowing with rice gruel and that if a famine came, he could sell the food and earn silver from it. This silver could then be used to buy a pair of goats who would soon have kids and create a herd. This herd in turn could be traded for buffaloes who would give milk from which he could make dairy products. These products could be sold in the market for more money.


This money would help him get married to a rich woman and together they would have a son who he could scold and love in equal measure. He dreamt that when his son wouldn’t listen, he would run after him with a stick.
Wrapped up in his dream the Brahmin picked up the stick near his bed and started hitting  the air with the stick. While flailing about, he hit the earthen pot with the stick, the pot broke and all the contents spilled over him. The Brahmin woke up with a start only to realize that everything was a dream.
An old Stork lived on the side of a fish pond. He was too old to fish any longer, and he had to come up with an idea for food. Suddenly, he had a great idea.
He stood in the water with a sad face. A crab came up to him and ask him why he was so unhappy.


The Stork said "I've heard that this pond is going to dry up soon and now I have to fly away to another pond."
Concerned, the crab asked the stork to save the animals in the pond as well.
He would take a couple of fish in his beak and fly away towards another pond. Once he would reach far out of sight the pond, he would eat them. He did this many times.


Now it was the crab’s turn. As they were flying the crab looked down but could not see a pond however he saw a lot of fish bones. The crab immediately realized what was happening and grabbed the stork’s throat tight with his sharp claws. The stork struggled to get free. But the crab held on. Soon the stork fell to the ground. The crab crawled back to his pond to tell the story to the rest of the pond creatures.

Once there was an adventurous jackal who frequently strayed into the village looking for food. The Village was filled with dogs that scared the jackal. Although he was scared of the dogs, the jackal loved food and travelled to the city again and again.


One day, as he was going to enter a house, he heard barking. He was shocked to find a gang of dogs running towards the house. They looked violent and caused the jackal to panic. He ran and tumbled into a tub of blue dye. The dogs couldn’t see him and they ran another way.


Now the jackal was completely blue from head to toe. He appeared very different from any other animal. The jackal was pleased as no one would be able to recognize him and he could easily fool anyone in the jungle.
Just like he had thought, everyone in the jungle was surprised to see such an unusual animal.


The small animals, the lion and the tiger all asked who he was and who had sent him.
“I have been sent by God himself to look after you. I will now be the king of the jungle” The jackal said.


The lion protested saying he had always been the king of the forest.
“From now, that must change and all of you must serve me” The Jackal happily said.


Some animals like the tiger protested and asked what would happen if they didn’t obey him. He replied saying God would destroy the entire jungle if they didn’t.


Scared for their lives and their jungle, the animals asked the blue Jackal what he would like them to do.
“Bring me lots of food” said the blue jackal promptly.
The animals quickly scurried and returned with lots of food for the Jackal.
He had so much food that he gave his leftovers to the other animals and told them that they had to serve him fresh food every day.
He even threw out the pack of jackals from the forest because he knew that they could identify him some day.


The blue Jackal was very happy with himself for fooling the entire forest and was happy to be away from the city dogs.
But one day the banned pack of jackals was walking around the forest and howling loudly. The blue jackal began howling out of habit too.
Because of this mistake, the other animals quickly identified him as a jackal and destroyed him.

The crow then hastily drank from it and quenched his thirst.

Most of us have probably heard of this story as this is one of the most popular fairy tales in the world. The story revolves around a duckling who from the moment of his birth has always felt different from his siblings. He was always picked on because he didn’t look like the rest of them. One day, he had enough and ran away from the pond he grew up in. He wandered near and far looking for a family who would accept him. Months passed and seasons changed but everywhere he went, nobody wanted him because he was such an ugly duck. Then one day, he came upon a family of swans. Upon looking at them, he realized that during the months he spent looking for a family to call his own, he had grown into a beautiful swan. Now he finally understood why he never looked like the rest of his siblings because he isn’t a duck but a swan.

Moral of the story:

We shouldn’t be too quick to judge others based on their physical appearance. Just because someone doesn’t fit societal definitions of beauty doesn’t mean they’re ugly. Each of us is beautiful in our own unique way and it’s time we accept and celebrate that individuality.

Udhata, a thin donkey who was starved by his owner, a local fisherman, went in search of food with his friend, a jackal. The pair wandered around the village in the middle of the night until they stumbled upon a cucumber field. That night, they truly relished their meal and decided to pay a visit to the cucumber field every night. Udhata eventually began to look much healthier and was able to pick up more load.

Once, after an appetizing and wholesome meal of cucumbers, the donkey insisted on singing. Knowing that this was foolish, the jackal advised him against the same but the stubborn donkey refused to listen to his friend. Even when the jackal told the donkey that his voice wasn’t exactly sweet, Udhata dismissed his comment – thinking that the jackal was jealous. He told the jackal that he was happy, and there’s nothing wrong in expressing one’s happiness. Once again, the jackal warned him of his foolish behaviour and of bringing trouble upon himself by disturbing the guards. However, the foolish donkey would not budge.

When the donkey started to sing, the jackal interrupted and asked the donkey to wait until the jackal jumps over the other side of the fence for his own safety. The jackal decided to wait outside. On hearing the loud braying noise made by the donkey, the guard naturally awoke from his slumber. When he spotted Udhata, the guard beat him black and blue mercilessly. He didn’t hold back whatsoever and channelled all of his anger onto the donkey who was truly regretting not taking his friend’s advice. Once he was done, the donkey could barely move. Yet, he somehow dragged his limp body out of the field, where the jackal had been waiting for him. His friend had a sympathetic look on his face as he said, “I told you so.”

Once upon a time, a clever monkey resided on a tree that bore fresh, luscious berries. A day arrived when a crocodile swam up to the tree and told the monkey that he had travelled a very long distance and was extremely exhausted from his journey. The crocodile had been in search of food and was very hungry. On hearing this, the kind monkey offered him a few berries for which the crocodile was very thankful. He asked the monkey if he could visit him again soon for some fruit. The monkey happily agreed.

The crocodile came back the next day, and the day after that. Soon, this became a daily ritual and they grew to become good friends. As all friends do, they discussed the goings-ons of their lives and confided in each other.  The crocodile told the monkey about his wife who lived on the other side of the river. So, the generous monkey offered the crocodile some extra berries to take home for his wife.

She thought to herself that if the monkey survived on a diet of the tasty berries, his flesh must be really sweet. So, she asked the crocodile to invite his friend over to dinner. The crocodile refused because he knew that his wife was up to some nasty trick. However, she was determined to eat the monkey’s flesh.

She pretended to fall ill and told the crocodile that her doctor claims that the only thing that would keep her from dying is a monkey’s heart. On hearing this, the crocodile rushed to the monkey’s tree and lied to him saying that his wife had prepared them a delicious dinner. The monkey happily agreed and climbed onto the crocodile’s back. Halfway through, the monkey noticed that the crocodile began to sink. Frightened, the monkey asked his friend why he was doing that. The crocodile explained the situation truthfully.

The clever monkey told him that this was an unfortunate situation because he had left his heart at home. If the crocodile took him back, he would gladly give his heart away to nurse the crocodile’s wife back to health. The silly crocodile fell for the monkey’s clever lie and rushed back to the tree so that he could take the monkey’s heart. As soon as they reached, the monkey hastily scampered up to safety and told the crocodile to tell his wife that she had married a fool!

Gagan is not your stereotypical boy and that’s because he has a so-called ‘feminine’ side. His interests which include gazing at the view from his bedroom window or looking after ant hills differ from indulging in war stories and imaginary swordplay like the other boys. He is labelled as “Unboy’-ish due to the lack of his participation in typically masculine activities. A label that is used by his brother, his friends, other school children and even his grandfather – all of whom try to turn him into more of a ‘boy’.

‘Unboy’ is just one of the many names he is called, others being  “sissy”, a “chooha” or “little mouse”, “scaredy cat.” His only pillar of support is his mother, who encourages him to stay true to himself. Even though he was being told to act like someone he is not by society, he continues to be himself and takes pride in who he is.

In the book, there are times where he can’t help but feel excluded and targeted but he doesn’t let it get in the way of his kind nature and gentle personality. Despite being alienated by those who were meant to support him and love him, he never feels the need to apologise for his identity because at the end of the day, he knows that in his heart, he is a good human being. However, things change for Gagan when an unexpected incident happens. You’re probably wondering what that is. Well we don’t want to give away any spoilers – you’ll just have to read the book to find out!

A day arrived when three of the friends decided to go looking for jobs in distant towns and villages. They wanted monetary gain for their knowledge. After all, there was no use of being so learned in scriptures and sciences if they were not going to gain anything back from it. The three friends did not wish to take Subuddhi along because of his lack of intellect but since he was an old childhood friend, they decided to invite him too.

The four friends set out on a long journey, moving from one town to another in search of a way to earn money. While passing through a dense forest, they discovered a bunch of bones lying under a tree. They decided that a fine opportunity to display their powers had presented itself.

The first friend used his skills to assemble the bones into a skeleton. When the skeleton was ready, the second friend chanted a mantra, which lead to the formation of flesh and meat on the skeleton. It looked like a lifeless lion. Just as the third friend was about to end the show by bringing the lion back to life, the fourth friend stopped him. Subuddhi knew that once the ferocious lion was brought back to life, it wouldn’t spare them.

However, the third friend ignored his advice, made fun of him and went ahead with something that was clearly a bad idea. Subuddhi quickly climbed up a tree nearby to protect himself as the third friend began to chant, thereby bringing the lion back to life. As predicted by the fourth friend, the lion killed all three of the learned friends while Subuddhi rushed back to the village, alive.

Sandeep Maheshwari ek India ke Top Entrepreneur hai, jo ki ek Business Man, Motivation Speaker bhi hai.�Inhone apni Study bich me se hi chor di�jo ki�Kirori Mal College�se B.Com kar rahe the. Study chorne ke unke kuch personal reasons the, par wo ye jante the ki unko Life me kuch karna hai, or unka motto tha Success hona. Har ek ki life me ek turning point jarur aata hai, or agar ham sirf waha sabhal jaye�to ha jo chate hai wo hame naa mile aesa ho hi nahi sakta. Aap kuch bhi kaam kare, usme fail hone se mat daro, q ki agar aap fail ho rahe ho, or uske baad bhi haar nahi maan rahe ho iska matlab hai aap apne aapko or majbut bana rahe ho. Sandeep Maheshwari Aaj ek Successful insan hai, jinko lakho log follow bhi karte hai, par kya aapko pata hai unki iss success ke piche kitne failure hai.. chaliye jante hai Sandeep Maheshwari ki Life ke ware me. Inki family ka�Aluminum business tha, jo ki puri trha se thap ho gaya, to iska aasar ghar ke 19 saal ke ladke Sandeep par bhi padha.. Or Ghar ki iss situation me help karne ke liye ek Multi Level Marketing (MLM) join ki, jisme wo kuch hadd tak success bhi hue.. Par agar aapne kabhi MLM try kiya ho to aapko bhi pata hoga, MLM me ham Long tarm tak kaam nahi kar sakte.. aesa hi Sandeep Masheshwari ke sath huaa.. Unhone bhi usko chor diya. MLM company ko to unhone chor diya, par jitne time tak wo usme kaam kar rahe the, usme unhone bhut si chije sikhi, or sambe main baat jab wo MLM kar rahe the to unhone Marketing ki bhut books bhi padhi. Marketing ka unko itna knowledge ho gaya tha ki unhone, Marketing ke upar ek Book bhi likh di, lekin Book bhi ek Failure hi sabit hui. Jo sandeep maheshwari book likhi thi, uski bhi ek khas baat thi, wo ulti open hoti thi matlab piche se or uske sabse phele Page par hi likha tha agar aap apne padhne ka tarika nahi badal sakte, to aap apni soch ko kaise badal sakte ho. Ye jo Book likhi, Marketing ke upar bhale wo success nahi hui, par usko likhne se jo Sandeep Maheshwari ko mila wo sabse badke tha.. Q ki unhone ek book likhne ke chakkar me pata nahi kitni marketing ki book badh dali, jisse unko marketing ka acha khasa knowlage ho gaya. Sandeep Ka Interest Modeling me bhi tha, to unhone in sab ke baad modeling�me try karne ka socha or apna ek portfolio banbaya, Yaha bhi unhe bhut si problem ka samna karna padha q ki koi bhi acha Photographer 50 hajar ke aas pass charge karta hai ek portfolio ke jo ki unke liye bhut jada tha.. Fir bhi jese tese banbaya or try kiya par usme bhi unko koi acha response nahi mila. Ab Sandeep ne socha jo mere jese Models hai jo Paise ke karan apna�portfolio nahi banwa pa rahe hai, me unki help karu or�portfolio banao, or unhone Camera leke ye kaam start kiya. Camera liya or ek photograph ka course kiya. or kisi ka bhi wo portfolio banate to sirf Camera Real ke paise usse lete or thoda bhut extra. Iske baad unhone apne 3 dosto ke sath milke ek company bhi start ki jo 6 mahine me hi band karni padi, q ki unke dost usko chor ke chale gaye.. Yani ek or aasafalta hath lagi. Ab Sandeep Maheshwari ne Models ke Photo khichna bhi start kar diya tha, jo advertisement company ko sale karke paise kama sakte hai, or agar koi photo sale hota tha to jo uska model hota tha usko bhi uska percent milta tha. Ab Uske pass clint to aa rahe the, par unko apna business badana tha to unko kuch aesa karna tha jisse wo sabki najar me aa jaye, q ki phele se bhut se photographer the par unko unsab me highlight hona tha. Sandeep ne Limca Book of World Record se contact kiya, or 10 ghanto me lagatar 100 se jada models ke 10000+ photo khich kar World Record bana diya.. jisse unki News TV or Paper me aai to wo sabki najro me aa gaye. ab Sandeep ko�idea aaya ki wo ek website banaye jisme wo apne khiche hue photo ko online sale kar sake. unhone web Developer se ek website banwai jiska naam tha imagesbazaar.com, jisko pura teyar karne me lagbhag ek saal laga, par ye website apni trha ki pheli website thi jisme Indian Models ke photo the jo kisi bhi Advertisement ya marketing ke liye use kiye ja sakte the. Website banne ke baad, ek sabse badi problem aai, wo ye ki website load hone me 2-3 minute laga rahi thi, or itni slow site par koi aake image ko kaise kharid sakta tha.. jisse fir ek time aesa aa gaya ki lagne laga ye website ka idea bhi galat hi raha. q ki jo Developer the unhe bhi kya dikkat hai wo samaj nahi aa rahi thi. Par yaha Sandeep Maheshwari ne iss idea ko drop karne se phele socha q naa me khud isko solve karu, iske liye unhe programming nahi aati thi to unhone online or books se read karke itni programming sikh li ki kis code ka kya matlab hai samaj me aa jaye.. or uske baad kaha kya dikkat thi wo bhi unko samaj me aa gaya. Ab Sandeep Maheshwari ne jo website ke developer the uske pass gaye or bole, ye hai problem imagesbazaar.com me, karo isko tikh.. or uske baad website ki loading speed bhut fast hogai or uspar visitor bhi aane lage. Aaj�ImagesBazaar.com India ki Top Image website hai jispar 15 lakh se jada High Quality Photo or Video hai. Is website par duniya bhar se clint image ko kharidte hai jinki sankhiya 7000+ hai. Aaj wo ek Successful insan hai or jo dusro ko motivate karke or logo ko bhi Success banane me mission me lage huee hai. Wo India ke Top Motivation Speaker me se ek hai jo Apne seminars ke paise nahi lete or bilkul free seminar karke apne life experience ko logo se share karke motive karte hai or yakin dilate hai ki sabkuch Aasan hai. In short agar ham�Sandeep Maheshwari ji ke success hone ke phele ke failures ko dekhe to hame pata chal jata hai jo bhi hota hai ache ke liye hi hota hai, or agar ham kuch bhi karte hai bhale usme fail huee ho uska hame aage fayda jarur milta hai.
